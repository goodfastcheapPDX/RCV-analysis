# Ranked-Choice Voting Analysis Platform - Product Requirements Document

## Vision
Build a comprehensive web application for analyzing ranked-choice voting elections using a static-first architecture. The platform will transform raw election data (CSV) into rich interactive visualizations that help users understand voting patterns, candidate relationships, and election outcomes.

## Problem Statement
Ranked-choice voting (RCV) elections generate complex data that's difficult to analyze without specialized tools. Stakeholders need:
- Clear understanding of how votes transfer between candidates
- Insights into voter coalition patterns 
- Validation of official election results
- Educational tools to explain RCV mechanics

## Solution Approach: CSV ‚Üí Static JSON ‚Üí Interactive Frontend

### Core Architecture Philosophy
1. **Static-First Pipeline**: Pre-process all election data into optimized JSON files
2. **Vertical Slice Development**: Build complete features (data + UI) one at a time
3. **Domain Learning Through Visualization**: Use frontend interactions to validate algorithms
4. **Performance Through Pre-computation**: Sub-100ms page loads via static data

## Domain-Specific Mathematical Requirements

### STV Algorithm Implementation
- **Droop Quota Calculation**: `floor(votes/(seats+1)) + 1`
- **Vote Transfer Logic**: Surplus redistribution with fractional weights
- **Elimination Strategy**: Lowest vote total candidates removed first
- **Winner Determination**: Candidates reaching quota threshold

### Coalition Analysis Mathematics
- **Affinity Scoring**: Jaccard similarity with proximity weighting
- **Network Centrality**: Degree, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality
- **Transfer Prediction**: Historical pattern-based modeling
- **Coalition Strength**: Multi-factor weighted scoring system

### Statistical Computations
- **Ballot Completion Analysis**: Ranking depth distribution
- **Preference Correlation**: Candidate co-occurrence patterns
- **Voter Segmentation**: K-means clustering on preference vectors
- **Transfer Efficiency**: Actual vs predicted transfer rates

## Development Strategy: Vertical Slice Approach

### Why Vertical Slices?
- **Domain Learning**: Each complete feature validates election math understanding
- **Rapid Feedback**: Working UI reveals algorithm correctness immediately  
- **Risk Mitigation**: Complex election math validated through visual interaction
- **Incremental Value**: Each slice delivers standalone user value

### Slice Development Process
1. **Mathematical Research**: Understand the election theory
2. **Algorithm Implementation**: Build computational logic in TypeScript
3. **Data Generation**: Create static JSON for the feature
4. **Frontend Development**: Build interactive visualization
5. **Domain Validation**: Verify results match election theory expectations

### Success Criteria Per Slice
- **Dashboard**: Official winners correctly identified
