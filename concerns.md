# Data Loading Concerns for Rank Distribution Visualization

## Performance Issues

### Client-side Filtering Performance
- **Issue**: Loading entire contest-level rank distribution artifacts (potentially 100k+ rows) to filter for one candidate
- **Risk**: Memory pressure and slow initial renders on candidate pages
- **Impact**: Poor user experience, especially on mobile devices

### Bundle Size in Storybook
- **Issue**: Large JSON fixtures could bloat development build
- **Risk**: Slow Storybook startup and large dev bundles
- **Mitigation**: Keep fixtures minimal, focus on edge cases rather than realistic data volumes

### Cache Invalidation Strategy
- **Issue**: No clear strategy for when rank distribution data becomes stale
- **Risk**: Users see outdated data without knowing it
- **Current State**: Static file loading assumes data is immutable

## Error Resilience

### Manifest-File Consistency
- **Issue**: Manifest claims artifact exists but file is missing/corrupted
- **Risk**: Silent failures or cryptic error messages
- **Need**: Graceful degradation with clear error messages

### Schema Evolution Handling
- **Issue**: Zod guard needs to handle schema changes gracefully
- **Risk**: Hard failures when slice output format evolves
- **Need**: Backward compatibility or clear migration paths

### Network Failure Recovery
- **Issue**: Static file loading can still fail in various ways
- **Risk**: Poor user experience without retry mechanisms
- **Need**: Exponential backoff and user-friendly error states

## Memory Management

### Memoization Scope Limitations
- **Issue**: React.useMemo might not be sufficient for large datasets
- **Risk**: Re-filtering large datasets on every render
- **Need**: More sophisticated caching layer

### Component Lifecycle Management
- **Issue**: Large filtered datasets need proper cleanup
- **Risk**: Memory leaks when components unmount
- **Need**: Proper cleanup in useEffect returns

### Concurrent Page Loading
- **Issue**: Multiple candidate pages open simultaneously multiply memory usage
- **Risk**: Browser performance degradation
- **Need**: Global memory management strategy

## Data Consistency

### Race Condition Risks
- **Issue**: Manifest updates while component is loading could cause partial data
- **Risk**: Inconsistent or corrupted visualization state
- **Need**: Atomic loading or proper loading state management

### Temporal Data Coupling
- **Issue**: Golden fixtures and actual slice output could drift apart
- **Risk**: Storybook shows different behavior than production
- **Need**: Automated fixture validation against real data

### Cross-Component Data Sharing
- **Issue**: Multiple components might load the same large dataset
- **Risk**: Unnecessary network requests and memory duplication
- **Need**: Application-level data sharing strategy

## Proposed Monitoring

1. Add performance metrics for data loading times
2. Implement size limits and warnings for fixture generation  
3. Add data freshness indicators in UI
4. Create error boundaries with diagnostic information
5. Monitor memory usage patterns in development

## Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Client-side filtering performance on large datasets
- **Medium Risk**: Memory management across multiple components
- **Low Risk**: Storybook bundle size (development-only concern)

Most concerns can be addressed incrementally without blocking initial implementation.
