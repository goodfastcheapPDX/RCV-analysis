https://vscode.dev/github/goodfastcheapPDX/RCV-analysis/blob/feat/rank-distribution-viz-per-candidate/src/components/candidate/RankDistributionCard.tsx#L56 makes no sense. the data is being passed as a prop but it's parents don't pass any data. the page needs to get the data and send it down. the tabs component should be fetching data either
- round explorer updates
    - progress bar
    - cross out eliminated names
- implement a typography system
- coalition mass graph: https://github.com/vasturiano/react-force-graph
- implement logging library
- move src/packages/contracts up to src root
- empty src/packages
- standardize test spec file naming and file location
- standardize test fixture generators
- cleanup nonsensical test data/ folders like data/corrupt-test
- cache all the data for the app in a big object at the top and useContext to get it in lower abstractions. don't be fetching data all over the componentry willy nilly
