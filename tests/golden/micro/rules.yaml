# STV Election Rules Configuration
# This file defines the rules for Single Transferable Vote (STV) counting

# Number of seats to be filled
seats: 3

# Quota calculation method (currently only 'droop' is supported)
# Droop quota = floor(total_valid_ballots / (seats + 1)) + 1
quota: droop

# Surplus transfer method (currently only 'fractional' Gregory method is supported)  
# Fractional method: transfer_weight = surplus / candidate_total
# Each ballot transfers at: original_weight * transfer_weight
surplus_method: fractional

# Numerical precision for vote comparisons (default: 1e-6)
# Used for comparing vote totals with quota and determining equality
precision: 1e-6

# Tie-breaking method for eliminations
# 'lexicographic': alphabetical order by candidate name
# 'random': use random_seed for deterministic randomness (future feature)
tie_break: lexicographic

# Optional random seed for tie-breaking (not currently used)
# random_seed: 12345
